## COVID-19 Time Series Map

I created this app to track and analyze the confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries of the COVID-19 virus in more than 140 countries around the world. Data was gathered and cleaned from [JHU's CSSE](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19). See my 
[Global COVID-19 Timeseries Dashboard](https://alexanderbates.shinyapps.io/covid_19_timeseries/).
